There are many ways to include CSS in a web application, and correspondingly there are many ways to include CSS in Storybook. Usually, it is best to try and replicate what your application does with styling in Storybook’s configuration.

### CSS-in-JS

CSS-in-JS libraries are designed to use basic JavaScript, and they often work in Storybook without any extra configuration. Some libraries expect components to render in a specific rendering “context” (for example, to provide themes), and you may need to add a [global decorator](../../writing-stories/decorators.mdx#global-decorators) to supply it.

### Importing CSS files

If your component files import their CSS, Storybook's webpack configuration will work out of the box. The noticeable exception to this is if you're using a CSS precompiler. In this case, you can either install and configure a Storybook preset (e.g., [SCSS preset](https://github.com/storybookjs/presets/tree/master/packages/preset-scss)), or customize [Storybook's webpack configuration](../../builders/webpack.mdx#extending-storybooks-webpack-config) and include the appropriate loader.

With Angular, you'll need to take special care of handling CSS.

### Working with previous versions

If you're working with an older version of Angular, in addition to providing a custom Webpack configuration, you can also use an inline loader to load your CSS safely. For example:

```js
import '!style-loader!css-loader!./styles.css';
```

### With Angular 13

With Angular version 13 and above, you should use a builder configuration to import your CSS, for example:

```json
  {
    "my-project": {
      "architect": {
        "build": {
          "builder": "@angular-devkit/build-angular:browser",
          "options": {
            "styles": ["src/styles.css", "src/styles.scss"]
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
```

Additionally, if you need Storybook specific styles that are separate from your application, you can configure the styles with [Storybook's custom builder](https://storybook.js.org/docs/6), which will override the application's styles:

```json
  {
    "storybook": {
      "builder": "@storybook/angular:start-storybook",
      "options": {
        "browserTarget": "my-default-project:build",
        "styles": [".storybook/custom-styles.scss"]
      }
    }
  }
```

### Nx with Angular 13

If you're working with Storybook and [NX libraries](https://nx.dev/structure/library-types), you can extend your project's configuration (i.e., `project.json`) and provide the application's styles. For example: 


```json
 "build-storybook": {
    "executor": "@nrwl/storybook:build",
    "outputs": ["{options.outputPath}"],
    "options": {
      "uiFramework": "@storybook/angular",
      "outputPath": "dist/storybook/example-lib",
      "config": {
        "configFolder": "libs/example-lib/storybook/.storybook"
      },
      "projectBuildConfig": "example-lib:build-storybook",
      "styles": ["apps/example-app/src/styles.scss"]
    },
    "configurations": {
      "ci": {
        "quiet": true
      }
    }
  }  
```

</IfRenderer>

To use your CSS in all stories, you import it in [`.storybook/preview.js`](../index.mdx#configure-story-rendering)

### Adding webfonts

If you need webfonts to be available, you may need to add some code to the [`.storybook/preview-head.html`](../story-rendering.mdx#adding-to-head) file. We recommend including any assets with your Storybook if possible, in which case you likely want to configure the [static file location](./images-and-assets.mdx#serving-static-files-via-storybook-configuration).
