<details>
  <summary><code>storybook init</code> is not made for empty projects</summary>

  Storybook needs to be installed into a project that is already set up with a framework. It will not work on an empty project. There are many ways to bootstrap an app in a given framework, including:

  * üì¶ [Create an Angular Workspace](https://angular.io/cli/new)
  * üì¶ [Create React App](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html)
  * üì¶ [Create a Vue App](https://vuejs.org/guide/quick-start.html)
  * üì¶ [Ember CLI](https://guides.emberjs.com/release/getting-started/quick-start/)
  * Or any other tooling available.
</details>

Storybook will look into your project's dependencies during its install process and provide you with the best configuration available.

The command above will make the following changes to your local environment:

* üì¶ Install the required dependencies.
* üõ† Setup the necessary scripts to run and build Storybook.
* üõ† Add the default Storybook configuration.
* üìù Add some boilerplate stories to get you started.
* üì° Set up telemetry to help us improve Storybook. Read more about it [here](../configure/telemetry.mdx).

Depending on your framework, first, build your app and then check that everything worked by running:

{/* prettier-ignore-start */}

<CodeSnippets path="storybook-run-dev.md" />

{/* prettier-ignore-end */}

It will start Storybook locally and output the address. Depending on your system configuration, it will automatically open the address in a new browser tab, and you'll be greeted by a welcome screen.

![Storybook welcome screen](../_assets/get-started/example-welcome.png)

There are some noteworthy items here:

* A collection of useful links for more in-depth configuration and customization options you have at your disposal.
* A second set of links for you to expand your Storybook knowledge and get involved with the ever-growing Storybook community.
* A few example stories to get you started.

  <summary><h3 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h3></summary>

  Below are some of the most common installation issues and instructions on how to solve them.


  {/* prettier-ignore-start */}

  <IfRenderer renderer='angular'>

    * Add the `--type angular` flag to the installation command to set up Storybook manually:
      
      ```shell
        npx storybook init --type angular
      ```

    * Storybook's CLI provides support for both [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) package managers. If you have Yarn installed in your environment but prefer to use npm as your default package manager add the `--use-npm` flag to your installation command. For example:
      
      ```shell
        npx storybook init --use-npm
      ```
    
    * Storybook supports Webpack 5 out of the box. If you're upgrading from a previous version, run the following command to enable it:
      
      ```shell
        npx storybook@next automigrate
      ```

      Check the [Migration Guide](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/blob/next/MIGRATION.md#automigrate) for more information on how to set up Webpack 5.
    
    * If you're using the custom Storybook builder, Storybook will not automatically open a browser window or tab. It's is a known issue that we plan to fix in future releases.
    * When adding Storybook to your Angular project, check if you're running the install command from the root directory. Or in a monorepo environment inside the directory where the `angular.json` file is located.
    * If you need further customization to the Storybook builder configuration, you can use the following table as a reference:
      
      | Configuration element        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                        |
