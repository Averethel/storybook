## Working with MDX

Similar to other documentation-oriented Doc Blocks such as [`TypeSet`](./doc-block-typeset.mdx), or [`ColorPalette`](./doc-block-colorpalette.mdx), the `IconGallery` is also typically used with MDX. It allows you to provide additional customization via options. Below is a condensed example and table featuring all the available options.
